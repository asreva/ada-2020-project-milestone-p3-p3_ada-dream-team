# P3 Milestone submission: Friendship distribution in function of the home position
### 1. Abstract:
Our project extension aims to inspect the difference in quantity, quality and distribution of friends according to where a person lives. Cultural factors, as well as geography and political decisions, may influence the result. We will analyse the problem in different countries.
To do so, we will use BrightKite and Gowalla datasets. From them, we will compute users' nationalities and friendships characteristics such as proximity, quantity of friends and frequency of meeting. With these data, we will be able to assert (or no) the significance of regional disparities. We will inspect further what is the cause of it using another dataset that includes characteristics of each country (mobility, wealth, ...). 
By doing this study, we may find the factors that increase the number of friends or bring them closer, which may be solutions against the threat of depression and isolation augmentation.
### 2. Research Questions:
1. Is there differences in terms of friendship characteristics depending on the country?
2. What are the factors that impact the number of friends? 
3. What are the factors that impact the proximity of friends?
4. What are the factors that impact the quality of friendships?
5. Is there a relation between the number and quality of friendships?
### 3. Proposed dataset:
1. Gowalla dataset: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-gowalla.html. A dataset from the paper. Checkins of users and friends relationship.
2. Brightkite dataset: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-Brightkite.html. A dataset from the paper. Checkins of users and friends relationship.
3. COUNTRIES DATASET
### 4. Methods:
1. Mapping (home position to country belonging)
2. Classification/Regression (try to predict the belonging or the characteristics when belonging to one country)
3. Matching (match people and countries that are comparable)
### 5. Proposed timeline:
1. Compute the nationalities
2. Compute friendships characteristics (number of friends, proximity of them, frequency of meetings)
3. Find similarities and disparities between countries
4. Find similarities and disparities between users
5. Matching countries and users
6. Infer the factors that influence friendships characteristics (feature importance)
7. Plotting and reporting results
### 6. Organization within the team:
1. Compute the nationalities [Week 12]
2. Compute friendships characteristics (number of friends, proximity of them, frequency of meetings) [Week 12]
3. Find similarities and disparities between countries [Week 13]
4. Find similarities and disparities between users [Week 13]
5. Matching countries and users [Week 13]
6. Infer the factors that influence friendships characteristics (feature importance) [Week 14]
7. Plotting and reporting results [Week 14]
### 7. Questions to TA's
1. Do we get the 6?
2. Just above what should we put?
